		<p>By opening this site, you've entered into the world of Razzle Dazzle, an idle game following the brothers El. In just a moment, you may pick your character...but first, a few questions about yourself.</p>

			<p>Very well, then. You've chosen to embark on this journey after all. Let me warn you, though—it won't be an easy one.<br><br>Chose which brother you wish to be:</p>

		<div class="hidden" id="hiddenDiv2Raz">
			<p>Your name is Raz El, potential heir to the El Throne. Since the day you were born, your dream has been to rule over the land controlled by your family, an ancient dynasty stretching back centuries.<br><br>You father, Ol' El, tragically passed away on the fields of battle, the proud armies of the El Family with him. Looking to strike in a time of weakness, the Azands have their eye on the El Throne.<br><br>Luckily, you're prepped and ready to ascend to the throne.<br><br>There's only one problem: Ol' El named neither of the twins (of which you comprise exactly 1/2 of), as his heir. And your brother, Daz, is refusing to give up his claim to the throne without a fight—for good reason.<br><br>Only one brother can come out of this successful. Pray it's you.</p>
